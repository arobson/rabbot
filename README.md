This is a very opinionated abstraction over amqplib to help simplify the implementation of several messaging patterns on RabbitMQ.

> !Important! - successful use of this library will require a conceptual knowledge of AMQP and an understanding of RabbitMQ.

### Features:

 * Attempt to gracefully handle lost connections and channels
 * Automatically re-assert all topology on re-connection
 * Support the majority of RabbitMQ's extensions
 * Handle batching of acknowledgements and rejections
 * Topology & configuration via JSON (thanks to @JohnDMathis!)
 * Built-in support for JSON, binary and text message bodies
 * Support for custom serialization

### Assumptions & Defaults:

 * Fault-tolerance/resilience over throughput
 * Prefer "at least once delivery"
 * Default to publish confirmation
 * Default to ack mode on consumers
 * Heterogenous services that include statically typed languages
 * JSON as the default serialization provider for object based message bodies

## API Example

This contrived example is here to make it easy to see what the API looks like now that documentation is broken up across multiple pages.



```js
const rabbot = require('rabbot');

rabbot.handle('MyMessage', (msg) => {
  console.log('received msg', msg.body);
  msg.ack();
});

rabbot.handle('MyRequest', (req) => {
  req.reply('yes?');
});

rabbot.configure({
  connection: {
    name: 'default',
    user: 'guest',
    pass: 'guest',
    host: 'my-rabbot-server',
    port: 5672,
    vhost: '%2f',
    replyQueue: 'customReplyQueue'
  },
  exchanges: [
    { name: 'ex.1', type: 'fanout', autoDelete: true }
  ],
  queues: [
    { name: 'q.1', autoDelete: true, subscribe: true },
  ],
  bindings: [
    { exchange: 'ex.1', target: 'q.1', keys: [] }
  ]
}).then(
  () => console.log('connected!');
);

rabbot.request('ex.1', { type: 'MyRequest' })
  .then(
    reply => {
      console.log('got response:', reply.body);
      reply.ack();
    }
  );

rabbot.publish('ex.1', { type: 'MyMessage', body: 'hello!' });


setTimeout(() => {
  rabbot.shutdown(true)
},5000);
```

## Roadmap
 * improve support RabbitMQ backpressure mechanisms
 * add support for Rabbit's HTTP API
