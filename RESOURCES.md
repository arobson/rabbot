## Additional Learning Resources

### Watch Me Code
Thanks to Derick Bailey's input, the API and documentation for rabbot have improved a lot. You can learn from Derick's hands-on experience in his [Watch Me Code](https://sub.watchmecode.net/categories/rabbitmq/) series.

### RabbitMQ In Action
Alvaro Vidella and Jason Williams literally wrote the book on [RabbitMQ](http://www.manning.com/videla/).

### Enterprise Integration Patterns
Gregor Hophe and Bobby Woolf's definitive work on messaging. The [site](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) provides basic descriptions of the patterns and the [book](http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Deploying/dp/0321200683) goes into a lot of detail.

I can't recommend this book highly enough; understanding the patterns will provide you with the conceptual tools need to be successful.
