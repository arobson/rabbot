### In Memoriam

Austin Young was an exceptionally bright software engineer that made material contributions to Wascally (the predecessor) which remain a big part of Rabbot today. Austin took on the challenging and somewhat tedious task of building the first pass at batch acknowledgements and the approach to testing them.

I remain grateful to Austin for his enthusiastic contribution.
